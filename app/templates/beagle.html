    <p>Here's a fun game - howl at your beagle and watch him howl back. Continue to 
        see who howls the loudest, or until the neighbours go crazy. Beagles are loved 
        across India for their affection and jolly personality. They're most often remembered 
        for their on-screen character, Snoopy, who stole the hearts of both children and 
        their parents. At a time when The Snoopy Show was playing in almost every household, 
        the industry witnessed a surge in the number of beagles finding homes. Unfortunately, 
        however, many people underestimated a Beagle's needs and took the breed for what they saw 
        on TV. As a result, many Beagles were either abandoned or given up for adoption.</p>
        <p>So, before you decide to get a Beagle, here's a sneak peek into what it's like to raise a dog 
            that would rather howl than bark to get its way.</p>
        
        <p>Originally bred to help flush out game, Beagles would sniff out prey from miles away. Whether 
        their prey lived in burrows like rabbits or on trees like the grouse and squirrel, a Beagle's 
        nose was no match for these hiders. The word 'Beagle' is derived from the french word 'beâ€™geule' 
        - symbolic of the sound that the Beagle would make to alert the hunter that they've sniffed out 
        prey.</p>
